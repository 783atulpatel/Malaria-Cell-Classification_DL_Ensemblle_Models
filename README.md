**Malaria Cell Classification**

using Custom Model, Inception V3, Efficient Model, and Validation with F1 Score, Precision, Recall Specificity, and Sensitivity

This project aims to develop and compare three deep learning models - a custom model, Inception V3, and Efficient Model - for the classification of malaria-infected cells. The models will be trained on a publicly available dataset of cell images from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that contains both malaria-infected and uninfected cells.

The performance of the models will be evaluated using F1 score, precision, recall, specificity, and sensitivity. The project will be implemented in Python, using TensorFlow and Keras libraries for deep learning.

To improve the generalization ability of the models, the dataset will be preprocessed and augmented using image augmentation techniques. The models will be trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. The best hyperparameters for each model will be selected using grid search.

The final model will be selected based on its F1 score, precision, recall, specificity, and sensitivity, and can be used as a tool to assist medical professionals in the accurate and efficient diagnosis of malaria.
